# LLM Courtroom Simulator

An AI-powered 3D virtual courtroom simulation that uses multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to create realistic legal proceedings. Each participant in the courtroom is controlled by an AI agent with unique personality traits, backgrounds, and objectives.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **3D Courtroom Environment**: Built with Three.js and React Three Fiber for immersive visualization
- **Multi-Agent System**: Each courtroom participant is an autonomous AI agent with:
  - Unique personality traits (assertiveness, empathy, analytical thinking, etc.)
  - Professional background and experience
  - Emotional states that evolve during proceedings
  - Memory systems (short-term, long-term, working memory)
  - Personal motivations and objectives

### Legal Proceedings Simulation
- **Complete Trial Phases**:
  - Pre-trial proceedings
  - Jury selection
  - Opening statements
  - Plaintiff/Prosecution case presentation
  - Defense case presentation
  - Witness examination and cross-examination
  - Closing arguments
  - Jury deliberation
  - Verdict
  - Sentencing (for criminal cases)

### Evidence Management
- Support for multiple evidence types (documents, images, videos, testimony, physical evidence)
- Chain of custody tracking
- Discovery process simulation
- Privilege protection
- Evidence admissibility determinations

### Interactive Features
- **User Role Selection**: Take control of any participant (judge, attorney, defendant, witness, jury member) or observe as all roles are AI-controlled
- **Real-time Interventions**: Make objections, present evidence, or speak during proceedings
- **Adjustable Simulation Settings**:
  - Simulation speed control
  - Auto-progress or manual phase advancement
  - Detail level (abbreviated to full proceedings)
  - Jury size configuration (6-12 members)

### LLM Integration
Supports multiple LLM providers for diverse AI behaviors:
- OpenAI (GPT-4)
- Anthropic (Claude)
- Ollama (local models)
- LM Studio
- OpenRouter
- Groq
- Grok
- Custom local endpoints

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-courtroom-simulator.git
cd llm-courtroom-simulator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure API keys (optional, for cloud LLM providers):
   - The application will prompt for API keys when needed
   - Keys are stored securely in local storage
   - Local models (Ollama, LM Studio) don't require API keys

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

### Quick Start
1. Launch the application
2. Click "Load Sample Case & Begin" to start with a pre-configured criminal case
3. Select your role (or remain as an observer)
4. Click "Start Simulation" to begin the proceedings
5. Watch as AI agents conduct the trial, or intervene if you've selected a participant role

### Controlling the Simulation
- **Start/Stop/Pause**: Control simulation flow with the control panel buttons
- **Speed Adjustment**: Use the speed slider (0.5x to 3x normal speed)
- **Manual Progression**: Disable auto-progress to manually advance through phases
- **User Actions** (when controlling a participant):
  - Type statements in the input field
  - Make objections (attorneys only)
  - Present evidence
  - Respond to questions

### Creating Custom Cases
The system supports custom case creation with:
- Case type selection (criminal, civil, family, corporate, constitutional)
- Legal system choice (common law, civil law, religious, customary, mixed)
- Custom participant configuration
- Evidence submission
- Charge/claim specification

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js + React Three Fiber
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Agent System (Inspired by Microsoft TinyTroupe)
Each agent features:
- **Cognitive Architecture**:
  - Thought generation before actions
  - Action planning with confidence levels
  - Evidence evaluation and analysis
  - Emotional state tracking

- **Memory Systems**:
  - Short-term memory for recent events
  - Long-term memory for persistent knowledge
  - Working memory for current context
  - Belief systems affecting decisions
  - Relationship tracking with other participants

- **Daily Routines**: Agents have simulated daily activities relevant to their roles (case preparation, research, client meetings, etc.)

### Proceedings Engine
The engine orchestrates the trial flow:
- Phase management and transitions
- Turn-taking and speaker management
- Objection handling and rulings
- Evidence presentation
- Sidebar conferences
- Transcript recording

## Configuration

### LLM Provider Setup
Each participant can use a different LLM provider. Configure in the settings:

```javascript
{
  provider: 'openai',
  model: 'gpt-4-turbo-preview',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  temperature: 0.7,
  maxTokens: 1000
}
```

### Local Model Setup (Ollama)
1. Install Ollama: https://ollama.ai
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama2`
3. The simulator will automatically detect and use local Ollama models

### Simulation Settings
```javascript
{
  realtimeSpeed: 1,          // 1x normal speed
  autoProgress: true,         // Automatic phase advancement
  detailLevel: 'standard',   // abbreviated/standard/detailed/full
  enableObjections: true,     // Allow AI objections
  enableSidebar: true,        // Enable sidebar conferences
  jurySize: 6,               // 6-12 jury members
  allowUserIntervention: true // Allow user to interrupt
}
```

### Adding New LLM Providers
1. Extend `BaseLLMProvider` class
2. Implement `generateResponse()` and `validateConfig()`
3. Register in `LLMProviderFactory`

### Customizing Agent Behaviors
Modify agent personalities and behaviors in `CourtroomAgent.ts`:
- Adjust personality trait ranges
- Modify emotional response patterns
- Customize role-specific behaviors
- Add new memory types or cognitive functions
